# Bug Report: GTK Interactive Debug Critical Errors

## Summary
When using GTK's interactive debugger (`GTK_DEBUG=interactive`), the application generates critical GTK errors related to CSS section handling, though the debugger functionality remains operational after the errors.

## Environment
- **GTK Version**: GTK4
- **Debug Command**: `GTK_DEBUG=interactive ./gtklayershelltest`
- **Application**: GTK Status Bar with Layer Shell integration

## Expected Behavior
GTK interactive debugger should launch without critical errors and provide debugging interface immediately.

## Actual Behavior
When launching with `GTK_DEBUG=interactive`, the application generates critical GTK errors before the interactive debugger becomes functional.

## Error Log
```
2025-09-14T00:22:25.952544Z DEBUG gtklayershelltest: Updating title label: GTK_DEBUG=interactive
2025-09-14T00:22:27.946270Z DEBUG gtklayershelltest: Handling title change event
2025-09-14T00:22:27.947487Z DEBUG gtklayershelltest: No active client matches the title change event

(gtklayershelltest:67026): Gtk-CRITICAL **: 18:22:28.151: gtk_css_section_get_bytes: assertion 'section != NULL' failed

(gtklayershelltest:67026): Gtk-CRITICAL **: 18:22:28.151: gtk_css_section_get_bytes: assertion 'section != NULL' failed
```

## Error Analysis
- **gtk_css_section_get_bytes**: Critical assertion failure suggests null CSS section being passed to GTK CSS handling
- **Timing**: Errors occur specifically during GTK interactive debugger initialization
- **Recovery**: Interactive debugger becomes functional after errors are logged
- **Frequency**: Consistent reproduction when using `GTK_DEBUG=interactive`
- **Scope**: Only affects debug sessions, not normal application startup

## Root Cause Hypothesis
Potential issues with:
1. GTK inspector trying to analyze CSS sections during initialization
2. Layer shell CSS interaction with GTK interactive debugger
3. GTK inspector CSS introspection conflicting with custom CSS providers
4. GTK debugger attempting to parse CSS sections that aren't fully loaded

## Impact
- **Severity**: Very Low - debugger remains functional after initial errors
- **User Experience**: Warning messages only during interactive debugging, no functional impact
- **Development**: May indicate GTK inspector CSS interaction issues
- **Scope**: Only affects development debugging, not production usage

## Recommended Actions
1. **Bisect**: Identify which CSS-related code triggers the null section assertion
2. **CSS Review**: Audit `load_css_styles()` and CSS provider setup for null handling
3. **GTK Version**: Test with different GTK4 versions to isolate version-specific issues
4. **Layer Shell**: Investigate gtk4-layer-shell interaction with GTK inspector

## Workaround
Ignore the critical errors - interactive debugger functionality remains intact after the initial error burst.

## Priority
**Low** - Development-only issue that doesn't affect end users or core functionality.
